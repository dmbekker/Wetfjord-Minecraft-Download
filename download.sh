# Script to download Wetfjord's (encrypted) world backup and store it for $KEEP_DAYS (default 7)
#
# Script will download from $URL_WORLD, then check the file checksum.
# If all is OK file will be renamed to prepend the current date to the file.
# If script is run multiple times per day, the file will be overwritten when renamed.

# Script created by David, use as you like.
